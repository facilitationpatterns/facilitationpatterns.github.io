title: "The purpose of the meeting is..."
category: opening
story: |
  
problem: |
  Most meetings don't have a clear, concise purpose that is known to all participants.
  
answer: |
  Start every meeting with the phrase "The purpose of the meeting is X".  This forces you to "begin with the end in mind":http://philosophersnotes.com/ideas/show/stephen-covey-stephen-covey-begin-with-the-end-in-mind
