title: We Language
category: language
story: |
  
problem: |
  When we use "I" to talk about our work, it implies a world of non-collaboration where we work side-by-side but not together. Worse, when someone feels that part of the work was theirs, it can hurt feelings and break trust.
  
answer: |
  Build team cohesion by using "We" instead of "I".  This is especially effective when talking about positive things like accomplishments.

This is distinct from [I Language] in that it's not about taking personal responsibility, it's about encouraging people to think of the team first.
