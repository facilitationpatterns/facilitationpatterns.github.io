problem: |
  Ideas are hard to talk to because you can't see or touch them.  As a result, conversations often lose focus or become personal instead of centering around the ideas.  

answer: |
  Capture the important ideas on index cards or stickies.  One idea per card.  These ideas can then be talked to, prioritized, sorted, tabled, etc.
