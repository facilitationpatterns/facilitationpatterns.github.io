title: No Handshakes
category: choosing
story: |
  "Where should we go for lunch?"
  "How about Thai?"
  [one person nods their head]
  "Great it's decided, we all want Thai"

problem: |
  After a question is put forth to a group, even after only a tiny fraction of the group answers the question, that answer can be treated as if it were representational of the group. This is a "handshake" and completely ignores the voices of the people in the group that are slower to talk.

answer: |
  Don't accept handshakes! If a question is put forth to the group, stop the group from moving on until the question is answered or explicitly dropped.
