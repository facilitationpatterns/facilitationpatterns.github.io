title: Lower My Status
category: safety
story: |
  Everyone was nervous.  This was day one of a quickstart, and noone really knew what to expect.  Definitely no one wanted to take the first step or look "goofy".  So Jeff did it for them.  "What's this all about?" He asked.  As the meeting continued, he kept asking questions that must have seemed obvious to everyone else.  But guess what?  After 1/2 an hour of Jeff being completely comfortable knowing nothing about the domain, he'd learned a whole lot, and everyone else was starting to ask silly questions too.  Of course, none of these questions were really silly.

problem: |
  When there isn't enough trust, people feel the need to guard their status, instead of working toward common goals.  You don't see them asking for help, you don't see them asking questions at all...

answer: |
  Model the "low status" behaviors (asking questions, asking for help...) you want to encourage.  Also by taking other "low status" actions, like sitting down or lowering your voice, you signal that it's okay to be low status in the current environment.
