problem: |
  In a large group, there can be too many opinions or too much to say.  Large groups also tend to favor extroverts over introverts.

answer: |
  Break the large group into smaller groups where each group is given a task to complete by itself. These smaller groups will work much faster and be more effective. Usually you'll combine the output of each group's separate work later.

Usually you want the groups to report back to the group as a whole so that everyone gets the benefit of their work.  This might be with a short summary that each group gives at the end, or each group might produce [physical_models] that the other groups can all inspect afterward.

h3. Variations

h4. 1-2-4-all

This [Liberating Structure] suggests that the group sizes are 1, then 2, then 4, then all. The timings are often very short, like 30 sec, 2 min, 4 min, 5 min.

h4. Set-Based Design

Each group separately does the same task

h4. Divide + Conquer

Each group does a different task and the work is split up.
