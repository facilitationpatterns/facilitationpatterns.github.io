title: Make a Request
category: language
story: |
  "Help me with this report."
  _could be_
  "Will you help me with this report?"

problem: |
  Demands are violent communication. They tear at the trust we have with each other and imply that we don't trust each other's judgement by taking away choice.

answer: |
  Make a request. Ask for what you want and be okay with the reply.

To be a "real" request, yes and no both have to be valid answers.
