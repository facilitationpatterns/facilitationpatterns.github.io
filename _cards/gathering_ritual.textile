  In an engaged group, energy may be high and the group focus will often not be on the facilitator, yet the facilitator may need to grab the focus to move the group on or otherwise redirect the group.

answer: |
  Use a gathering ritual to gently bring the focus of the group back to itself.

h2. Variations

There are many gathering rituals I have seen :

* Ring a bell (such as a Tibetan Temple Bell - it looks like a cymbal)
* Raise your hand (and the rest of the group will raise theirs)
* Put your finger on your nose
* Clap half of a rhythm (ta &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ta &nbsp; ta da da  ___ ___ - let them finish it)
* Sit down and wait for others to notice

* "Open Space Technology" for the Tibetan Temple Bell
* Andrew Sutton for the rhythm
* Kindergarden teachers for the hand raising and a finger on the nose
