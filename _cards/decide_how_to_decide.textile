title: Decide How To Decide
category: ground rules
story: |
  
problem: |
  Groups often get stuck at their first disagreement, if they have not yet decided how to make decisions, or worse yet, they have disparate ideas about how decisions are made.

answer: |
  Decide how to decide! There are no right answers. Decide by consensus, voting, fiat, or experimentation. Make sure you write down your decision strategy so that the group remembers it.

This works best when the facilitator has a couple resonable suggestions in her back pocket. Unanimous consensus is always an acceptable method of making decisions, so use it to decide how to decide (see [roman_voting]). 

Some reasonable suggestions:

* [roman_voting]
* Team lead breaks ties - This is simple, but requires that the team lead actually does step in to break ties.
* Try for consensus, then [roman_voting], then fiat - It's interesting to make the goal of consensus decisions explicit.
* Experimentation - If you can't decide, try both ideas out, then come together and choose one.

Then write it down, perhaps on a [big_visible_chart]
