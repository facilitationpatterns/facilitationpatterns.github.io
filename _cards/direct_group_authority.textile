title: Direct Group Authority
category: discussing
story: |
  

problem: |
  As a facilitator, you often need to direct the group, but just as often you lack any actual authority.

answer: |
  Borrow authority from the group.  By prompting the group to make agreements like "[Ground Rules]":/cards/ground_rules.html, you are then able to hold the group accountable to itself.

There are several ways to get authority, asking for it, using it for agreed upon things like "[Ground Rules]":/cards/ground_rules.html, asking the group a question, assuming it.
  
Make going off topic explicit (is this a separate pattern?)

A different approach to the problem of needing to direct group authority is to "[Raise My Status]":/cards/raise_my_status.html.
