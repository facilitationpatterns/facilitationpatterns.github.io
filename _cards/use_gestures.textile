title: Use Gestures
category: ground rules

problem: |
  People need to feel heard.  But often trying to meet this need comes in direct conflict with moving forward in a discussion.

answer: |
  Use agreed upon gestures to express agreement and readiness to talk.  Gestures provide a non-verbal, non-disruptive outlet to be heard that also allows the group to become better at self facilitation..

The three gestures that I have seen used are :

* "I'd like to say something"
* "I agree"
* "That person has been waiting to talk for a while"

In larger groups, people often start talking over each other or dominating conversations.  When this happens, have the group use gestures to indicate readiness to talk and agreement.  

This helps keeps people from talking over each other, and makes speaking up more accessible to people who have slower "lag" times
