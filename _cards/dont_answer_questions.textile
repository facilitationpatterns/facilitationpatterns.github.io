title: Don't Answer Questions
category: discussing
story: |
  

problem: |
  Every time you do for a system something that it should be able to do for itself, you weaken the system. Answering questions for a group that the group is capable of answering is an anti-pattern.

answer: |
  Don't answer questions. Turn questions back on the group. "That's a great question, does anyone have any ideas?"

Get 3 answers from the group, THEN give your opinion. This gives the group more confidence in themselves, buys you time to think, and often yields better results.
