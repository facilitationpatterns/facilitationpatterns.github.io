category: generating
story: |
  

problem: |
  You want to collect a lot of information from your participants quickly.  In these cases, the last thing you want to be is a bottleneck as in [facilitator_writes].

answer: |
  Allow your participants to write, prefereably all at the same time.  Then, use a pattern like [mind_map] or [stack] to make sense of what they've written.
